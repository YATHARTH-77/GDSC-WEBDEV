# Habit Tracker App

## Overview
This is a simple Habit Tracker web application that allows users to:
- Add new habits
- Track daily habit completion
- Maintain a streak for each habit
- Reset individual or all habits

## Features
- **Habit Management**: Users can add habits and track their progress.
- **Daily Reset**: Prevents duplicate completion on the same day.
- **Progress Summary**: Displays the number of completed habits.
- **Alerts & Encouragement**: Notifies users to keep up with their habits.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the page
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality

## How It Works
1. Users enter a habit in the input box and click the "Add Habit" button.
2. Each habit appears with a **streak count**, a **completion button (âœ…)**, and a **reset button (ðŸ”„)**.
3. Clicking the **completion button** increases the streak for that habit.
4. Clicking the **reset button** resets the habit's streak to 0.
5. The "Reset All Habits" button clears all habits.
6. A summary displays the total number of completed habits.
7. Alerts guide users to stay motivated when tracking habits.

## Improvements & Future Enhancements
- Store habit data in **localStorage** to retain progress after page reload.
- Add **habit categories** for better organization.
- Implement a **calendar view** to visualize habit progress.
- Enhance UI with animations and better responsive design.


## How to Use
1. Open `f3.html` in a browser.
2. Enter habits and start tracking your progress!
